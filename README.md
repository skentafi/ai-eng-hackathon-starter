# AI Engineer Hackathon Starter Repository

## Application Overview

This repository contains our submission for the AI Engineer Hackathon: a FastAPI-based AI Cost Estimator that predicts project costs based on structured input. The application is containerized with Docker Compose and includes a smoke-tested /estimate endpoint.

The estimator provides a transparent, rule-based cost breakdown for AI system components based on user-defined inputs. It does not rely on any machine learning model or vector database â€” all logic is defined in code, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility.

## Product Requirements
This estimator was designed to meet the challenge definitions and user scenarios outlined in our PRD. It supports:

- Scenario 1: Product Manager sanity check
- Scenario 2: Engineer planning infrastructure
- Scenario 3: Founder evaluating feasibility

You can view the full PRD, including design rationale and payload definitions, here: ðŸ”— [AI Cost Estimator PRD (Notion)](https://www.notion.so/PRD-team-two-28dbeb2b4c9f80ea9584f2db86e7fbca)

## Setup instructions
### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Docker Engine** - [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Docker Compose** - [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

> **Note**: If you're using Docker Desktop, Docker Compose is included automatically.

### Verify Installation
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version 
``` 
### Setup steps   
1. Clone the repository:    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skentafi/ai-eng-hackathon-starter
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd ai-eng-hackathon-starter
```
3. Copy the sample `.env` file and fill it with the required credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# You may override logic variant, currency, or S3 bucket settings here

```
4. Build the Docker images and start all services (first time build):
```bash
docker compose up --build
```   
or 
```bash
docker compose up
```

## Usage

Once the containers are running, open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) to access the Swagger UI.  
From here you can explore the API, send test requests, and view the schema definitions.

## Smoke Test Instructions (FastAPI Service)

To verify the containerized service is running and responsive:

1. Run `docker ps` and confirm container is `Up`
2. Open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
3. Send a sample payload to `/estimate` via Swagger or curl
4. Confirm 200 OK and valid response
5. Send `{}` to test error handling â€” expect 422 Unprocessable Entity
6. Run all three PRD scenarios (see below) to confirm cost logic and schema integrity

### Validated Scenarios

- **Scenario 1:** Inference + Monitoring, 1k requests â†’ Total: 810 USD
- **Scenario 2:** Fine-tuning + Compliance, 10k requests â†’ Total: 4,100 USD
- **Scenario 3:** Retrieval + Vector DB, 1k requests â†’ Total: 600 USD

See `docs/smoke-test.md` for full checklist, curl payloads, and expected outputs.


## To stop the services, run  
```bash
docker compose down
```
